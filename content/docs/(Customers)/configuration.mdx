# Configuration

The `config.toml` file is the central configuration file for the Telegram Advertiser Tool. This file allows you to set up the necessary parameters for connecting to the Telegram API and controlling the behavior of the message sending operations.

## Default Configuration
This is how a default configuration file looks like:

```toml
[telegram]
# Get your API ID/HASH from https://my.telegram.org/auth

phone_number="+12 34567890"
api_id=123456789
api_hash="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456"

[sending]
# The send interval is how long you want to wait between sending messages.
# The loop interval is how long you want to wait before re-sending messages to all the groups.
# We recommend not touching these values unless you know what you are doing.

send_interval=0
loop_interval=5
```
