# Environment Variables

The Telegram Advertiser Tool uses environment variables to configure the application. You can set these variables in a `.env` file in the root of the project.

```bash
FERNET_DECRYPTION_KEY=your_key_here
```

## FERNET_DECRYPTION_KEY

This key is used to encrypt and decrypt the Telegram API token. It is recommended to use a random key with 32 bytes.

### How to generate a valid key

You can generate a valid key using the following Python code:

```python
# py -m pip install cryptography --upgrade
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

key = Fernet.generate_key()
print(key)
```

Paste the generated key in the `.env` file without the annotations. (`The 'b' and the string quotes part`)
